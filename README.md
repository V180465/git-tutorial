# git-tutorial
This is a project delegated from KnowledgeHut.  This practical involves cloning, creating branches and putting files into the gitignore file.  
On Jan 28, 2024 the instructor for KnowledgeHut gave 3 Assignments involving "git."  I broke down the assignments into Assignments A, B & C.
This particular assignment is Assignment A. 
Thank you.
